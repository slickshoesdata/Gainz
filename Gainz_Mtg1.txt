Two possible indices:
* Wilks (used now)
   * Corrects for gender and weight classes
* Allometric Scaling
   * Controls for bodyweight considering amount lifted. 


Wilks isn’t always used for scoring, depending on weight classes.


Null:        Wilks is the best (least biased)
Alt:        WIlks is not the best
What indicates biased? 
        If unbiased, we should an equal spread of genders and weight-classes.
        
To-Do:
1. Representation of weight classes in top (1, 5, 10)% of scores
2. Distribution of scores, (wilks, allo, Z)
3. Dist of weight lifted
4. Representation of genders (bar plot) in top (1, 5, 10)%
5.
